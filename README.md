## Course Overview

This course assumes zero knowledge of Ethereum and other blockchain based technologies. It is geared towards students with a passion for emerging technologies and a desire to learn what's on the bleeding edge to further their professional careers. BIT has a project driven philosophy students will gain fundamental knowledge about how a blockchain works and will leave with hands on experience. The course is broken up into two parts, the first being a technical overview of blockchain fundamentals. The second part builds upon that knowledge where the student will implement a smart contract. Learning will occur in the form of in-person/online lecturers and one on one programming sessions. Learning will be assessed and measured through project deliverables.

### Part 2 - Implementing Smart Contracts

**Understanding the tech stack**

  

In this module we will go in depth into the technology stack used to host, write, deploy, test and interact with Smart Contracts. Students will download and create simply applications to become familiar with these tools.

**Node**
-   Node.js
-   Npm
-   Web3
    

**Ethereum**
-   Ganache
-   Solidity
-   Metamask
-   Truffle
    
#### Assignment- 
Download and integrate any npm package into a simple app and publish on Github

### Development tooling 

-   Github
-   CircleCI
-   Docker images
-   Private Environment variables 
    
#### Assignment-
Publish node Hello World application on github with CircleCi and Docker image

  

### Hello World Contract
In this module students will bring all the tools they have been learning and create and deploy a smart contract themselves
-   Smart Contract Creation
-   Test-driven with Truffle
-   Deployment
-   Interaction
    
#### Assignment-
Using test driven development build and deploy smart contract with CircleCI continuous integration to a test net
